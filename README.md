<h1>So, what's this?</h1>
Personal webpage using Node Js although its a static website. 

<h1>Why Node js?</h1>
Because I was learning Node js recently (by the time this was made) and I want to implement it. Simply as that.
Sorry, because I'm stupid.
But, I'm planning to add some dynamic contents and improve it. 

<h1>How can I look the page?</h1>

<h1>Can I run locally on my laptop?</h1>
<ol>1. Install Node js in your machine.</ol>
<ol>2. Clone/download this project.</ol>
<ol>3. Go to directory of the downloaded project.</ol>
<ol>4. Open terminal, enter command "npm install".</ol>
<ol>4. Open browser, go to localhost:3000.</ol>

Special thanks for the help from my friend R. Teguh that actually made me finished this. <br>
I actually started making personal page since year ago, but I confused so much then desperately quit after 2 or 3 trials(I forgot).
